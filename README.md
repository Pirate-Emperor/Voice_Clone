# Voice Clone AI Project

This project aims to create a voice cloning system using artificial intelligence (AI). It allows users to input a short audio sample of a speaker and then synthesizes speech in the same voice.

## Features

- **Voice Cloning**: Users can provide an audio sample of a speaker, and the system will clone the voice.
- **Speech Synthesis**: The cloned voice can be used to synthesize speech from text input.
- **Speaker Verification**: The system can verify the identity of the speaker based on the audio sample.
- **High-Quality Output**: The synthesized speech closely resembles the original voice, with natural intonation and cadence.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (numpy, scipy, librosa, pyaudio, etc.)

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pirate-Emperor/Voice_Clone.git
cd Voice_Clone
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be prompted to input the path to the audio sample of the speaker. After the voice is cloned, you can input text to synthesize speech in the cloned voice.

## Data Source

The project uses a pre-trained deep learning model for voice cloning. You can fine-tune the model with your own dataset if needed.

## Development

To add more features or improve the existing ones, you can modify the Python scripts in the `src` directory. Some potential areas for improvement include:

- Enhancing the quality of the synthesized speech
- Reducing the amount of data required for training
- Increasing the speed and efficiency of the voice cloning process
