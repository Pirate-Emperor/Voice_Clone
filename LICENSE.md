# A humble request

Our mission is to make artificial intelligence accessible & enjoyable, so we can all build bridges to the future, together.

Please, feel free to use this as you see fit in accordance with the law & ideally inline with our values of accessibility, equality & AI for all.

We only have one humble request (not requirement) ... that you represent these values by adding one of our (extremely awesome) AI badges on your website / github / etc. 

ðŸ‘‰ You can generate & customize your own here: [https://serp.ly/@serpai/badges/ai](https://serp.ly/@serpai/badges/ai)

Thank you!
